The current version should be run in emulator/container and it supports two-player mode.

Little change we've added:
Automatic skip: If there's only one move that the player can make, we will automatically do it for the player.
For example: If it is the turn for the player to pick up a tile, since the player can't do anything else except picking up 
the tile, we will do the pick up for the  player and the turn will come back to the player later.
If it is the turn for the player to decide whether to Peng or not, if the player is not able to Peng(The tile sequence at the player's
hand doesn't allow the player to Peng) and the only move the player can make is refusing Peng, we will also automatically 
do it for the player.
